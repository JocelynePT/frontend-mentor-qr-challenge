## My process

Follow these steps assuming that you already created the html and css files. 

1. In the header of the HTML file, add the HTML boilerplate (in VS Code is just writing "html" and select "html:5" from the list). 
2. In the header of HTML file, add the Bootstrap CDN link, the link to the css stylesheet file, the link of the Google Font suggested in one of the original README files of the challenge, and finally a reference for the icon. NOTE: I preferred to use Bootstrap, however, the challenge says that we are free to use whatever we want. Another important thing is if you use Bootstrap and Google Fonts, I recommend to put the link in the referred order. 
3. In the body of the HTML file, add a container and the card with the image and text. Cards are pre-build elements from Bootstrap which can be customized as you like. You can check the code and notice that the code to create this cards is very short. 
4. In the CSS file, I preferred to customized the style first and then positionate the card, just because I like more to styling things rather than positionating them. However, you will find a proposed solution if you want a guide. 

### What I learned

This exercise help me to reinforced my knowledge about positionating elements because as a Junior Frontend Developer is the part that is more difficult for me to understood but I'm happy that this challenge motivate me to do a research and put into practice this skill. 

If you are a student or a Junior Developer that needs help with this challenge, don't doubt to send me your question to learn together. If you're a Mid or Senior Developer with suggestions it will be nice sharing with me your thoughts so I can evolve as a programmer.

Have a nice day!
